Regression Problem to solve.
The dataset font is here: (https://www.kaggle.com/rubenssjr/brasilian-houses-to-rent)
for this project we are gonna use the Version2 of the dataset.

After verifying the integrity of the data and confirming that there is no missing or wrong data we can start the regression model.

In order to make a regression model for these data we have to separate the values and transform them into a single scale for the model to work. we will use the Sklearn library for this project for now. 
for the time being we use the decision tree models and the LinearRegression for the regression, we have achieved 60% correct indexes until then.
