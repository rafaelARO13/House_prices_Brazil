Regression Problem to solve.
The dataset font is here: (https://www.kaggle.com/rubenssjr/brasilian-houses-to-rent)
for this project we are gonna use the Version2 of the dataset.

After verifying the integrity of the data and confirming that there is no missing or wrong data we can start the regression model.

In order to make a regression model for these data we have to separate the values and transform them into a single scale for the model to work.

Taking into account that they have data from different cities and the value of the property changes from one city to another, we should use this as a categorical variable, and the others as area of the property and number of bathrooms and bedrooms as explanatory variables of the model.
